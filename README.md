Making the internet safer for kids

As of 2019, there are more than 4 billion people using the internet. While it has definitely made the world more connected but the anonymous nature of the internet also makes it extremely unsafe to use. Social media continues to be used by several to incite violence, spread hate and target minorities based on religion, sex, race and disabilities. Adults learn to handle these cases maturely but it can have a huge mental effect on kids. 

To solve this problem I am building a chrome extension which will scan whichever webpage I visit and search for cuss words from a dataset of cuss words on it. After finding cuss words it will hide the words by adding some css on top of it. I am also building a landing page where people can go find out more about the project.
